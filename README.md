# Network Utilities
A macOS application for network interface management on Apple Silicon Chips. <br>
This is my first sorta completed application not only in swift, but in any programming language. I had inspiration in this project because of the recent deprecation in the airport framework.

## Base Functions
- View current interfaces detected with "networksetup -listallhardwareports"
- View basic details on the currently selected interface

## Quick Functions
- Change MAC address on the currently selected interface with random and custom functionality

## Disclaimer
I only have this tested on a M3 Max Macbook Pro on Sonoma 14.4 and up so please let me know of any issues.
